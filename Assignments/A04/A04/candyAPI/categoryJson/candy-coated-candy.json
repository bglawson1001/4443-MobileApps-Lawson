We carry a number of classic colors that are available in a bulk candy package. Our dark blue M&Ms present a unique hue that you won't find in the typical store bought bag. Each piece is covered in a hard candy shell that presents a navy hue stamped with the candy's unmistakable letter logo.Each navy M&M features the same smooth chocolate center that has made this treat so popular. Order a bag so you always have your favorite color on hand to enjoy at home. Our dark blue version is also great for use in baby shower and wedding favors or can be served as part of an event. For even more festive fun, try combining two or three bags of our bulk M&Ms so you can set out candy bowls that alternate between colors!"
