## A06 - Location
### Brayden Lawson
### Description:

In this assignment Dr.Griffin wanted us to add a location feature to our app. The requirments are Show your own location based on what your phones gps gives you.
Show the location of more than 5 individuals on the map (along with you in the center).
The individual locations should come from a collection or table that is assumed to contain information from individuals who have clicked the non existant "share location" button.
When a users pin  is clicked in your map, it should show their first and last name.
Knowing that you need to show first / last name I am also restricting your location collection or table to only contain a users id, their location, and a timestamp.
This means, that when you build your map page, you will need to join your users collection and locations collection to get all necessary information.
